<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immunoglobulin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intramuscular Injection Human Immunoglobulin</li><li>Intravenous Injection Human Immunoglobulin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The immunoglobulin market is primarily categorized into two types based on administration routes: Intramuscular Injection Human Immunoglobulin (IMIG) and Intravenous Injection Human Immunoglobulin (IVIG). IMIG is administered via muscle injection, offering a slower absorption rate, suitable for specific immune deficiencies and conditions. Conversely, IVIG is delivered directly into the bloodstream, providing rapid therapeutic effects, commonly used for autoimmune disorders and severe infections. Both types play critical roles in enhancing immune responses and treating various medical conditions.</p></p>
